Now I am going to introduce myself. I am Dipanjan, the devlapor of this webpage. I was born on 10th May, 2002 at Sagar, the largest island of Sundarban. My father is Samar Ranjan Giri and my mother is Aparna Giri.
My first school was Chowrangi JNS Vidyaniketan where I took my primary education. I was admitted in this school in 2006 when I am four and half years old. Then in 2012 I was admitted in class five in ManasadwipRamakrishna Misson High School. By mid-2018, I passed secondary school with a slight higher schore of 82 percent. Then I was admitted in class 11 to Debnagar Mokhada Dinda H.S School for higher secondary education. This school is far from our home but i have to go there to maintain the family tradition. I dropped out of this school after complitted Class XI because of some problems by mid-2019 and then I was admitted to Dhablat Lakshman Parabesh High School (H.S.) in class twelve. In the year 2020, I passed the high school with the same percentage marks as I got in the secondary school. It was a very surprising thing to me. In September 2020, i was admitted to the B.Sc. Computer Science Department of Sammilani Mahavidlaya College, Kolkata. 
I am very fond of Cricket and electronic gadgets. About 50 to 70 percent of what I was given as handouts from home was spent on buying electronics gadgets. This was the short story of my life.
